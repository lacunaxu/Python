Welcome to the Lab Assignment 1! Please implement all the functions present in `lab1.py` and use the testing script provided to make sure your functions produce correct results.

## Testing your solution

    ```bash
    # To install dependencies on your local machine
    pip install -r requirements.txt

    # Finally, run the test suite
    pytest -v
    ```
- **GitHub Actions**
    - Push your latest version of changes
    - Now, you can see the evalution report under the `Actions` section of your repository
    - Everytime you push a new version of your code, a `GitHub Actions` workflow will be triggered and run.

## Evaluation Report

    > Here you are tested on public test cases (a part of the test suite)
- Check the greyed Annotations saying `Autograding complete` with same test score (This is not the actual score for your assignment). 
    > It means you pass all the public test cases. private test cases may also include tricky and edge cases for you shall implement proper logic to handle them well.
